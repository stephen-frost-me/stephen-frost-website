HTML Website
Hi there,
This is an ambitious project, having never coded a full website before I am wondering what i am letting myself in for.
However, I do seriously believe that going full HTML is going to be better long term than using WP, I just pray I can pull together all the learning and focus I need. With help where possible! :D
